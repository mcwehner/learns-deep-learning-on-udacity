## Assignment 2: SGD

### Rough notes

Both [`problem.py`][] and [`problem_v2.py`][] are needlessly complex iterations of the original problem, but were very instructive for learning a bit more of how to use [TensorFlow][].

[`problem.py`][] was the first attempt at some abstraction, and can be safely ignored.


[`problem.py`]:	./problem.py
[`problem_v2.py`]:	./problem_v2.py
